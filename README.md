# fire_experiment

This is my code for an experiment analyzing how primates attend to fire. I utilized a saliency model GBVS to assess if attending to fire was accounted for via saliency or through a quality of the fire itself.

## Introduction
This project aims to understand the visual attention of primates towards fire. By using the Graph-Based Visual Saliency (GBVS) model, we can determine whether the attention is due to the inherent saliency of fire or other factors.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Additionally, in a separate repository you need to clone GBVS using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreelock/gbvs
```
once cloned copy the saliency_models folder into the fire_experiment folder using:
```bash
cp -r gbvs/saliency_models fire_experiment/
```

## Usage
To use the code, run the following command:
```bash
python roi_saliency_extractor.py
```

## Results
The results of the experiment will be saved in the `results` directory. You can analyze these results to understand the attention patterns.
